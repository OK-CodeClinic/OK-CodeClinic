### 🔧 Environment Provisioning and Automation <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="./icons/terraform (1).png">
I specialize in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), leveraging tools like **Terraform** and **AWS CloudFormation** to provision and manage cloud environments efficiently and consistently.
#

### 🐳 Application Containerization with Docker <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="./icons/docker.png">
I build, optimize, and deploy Docker containers, ensuring portability and performance across development, staging, and production environments.
#

### ⚙️ Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="./icons/jenkins.png">
Fluent in CI/CD workflows using tools such as **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, **AWS CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, **CodeDeploy**, and **CodeCommit**, enabling rapid and reliable software delivery.
#

### ☸️ Container Orchestration with Kubernetes <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="./icons/kubernetes.png">
I have extensive experience with **Kubernetes** and **Amazon EKS**, managing microservices architectures at scale with automated deployments, scaling, and recovery.
#

### 🧰 Configuration Management <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="./icons/ansible.png">
I automate system configuration and application deployment using **Ansible**, improving efficiency and reducing human error across environments.
#

### 🔐 Infrastructure Security <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="./icons/security_check.gif">
Security is baked into everything I do. I work with services like:
- **AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)**

- **Amazon GuardDuty**
- **AWS KMS & Certificate Manager**
- **AWS Secrets Manager**

All to ensure your infrastructure is secure, resilient, and compliant.

I implement end-to-end observability with tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Amazon CloudWatch**, **AWS X-Ray**, and the **ELK Stack** to ensure system health and traceability.
